Welcome to APC's documentation!
===============================

**APC** is a C++ and Python library for rapidly propagating the orbits of near Earth objects using a 
variable fidelity gravity model as well as perturbations from atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure and third

APC utilizes APIs from the SPICE toolkit for sampling the orientations and positions of celestial bodies. CSPICE is provided by NAIF: https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/index.html

Work on APC has been made possible by funding from L3Harris.
